# Language Practice App 🌍

A personalized vocabulary "vault" and practice service designed to bridge the gap between learning new words and actually using them. This app allows users to catalogue their own study sets, import from Quizlet, and play interactive games powered by their own data.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Custom Vocab Vault:** Streamlined uploading for custom vocabulary, supporting multi-level formats (e.g., Chinese Characters + Pinyin + English).
* **Quizlet Import:** Seamlessly sync your existing study sets to get started in seconds.
* **AI-Powered Dialogues:** Generate realistic conversations using only the vocabulary you have uploaded to practice context.
* **Privacy Control:** Keep your sets private for personal use or make them public to contribute to the community library.
* **Cross-Platform Practice:** A consistent experience designed to work across different languages and scripts.

## 🕹️ The Game Suite

Practice your words through several interactive modes:
* **Word Swipe:** A fast-paced recognition game focusing on definitions and pronunciations.
* **Whack-a-Mole:** Rapid-fire character recognition.
* **Sentence Unscrambler:** Master grammar by rebuilding sentences from your vocab list.
* **TypeRacer:** A spelling-focused game with "hover-to-learn" tooltips for complex characters.
* **Bingo:** Multiplayer noun-recognition games for community sets.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview

The app is built with a flexible component-based architecture to handle different language requirements:
* **Database:** Structured to support $N$ levels of translation (Meanings, Phonetics, Scripts).
* **Algorithm:** Template-driven game logic that dynamically adjusts based on the language metadata.
